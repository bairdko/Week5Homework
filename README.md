###### Assigned: 7/5/18

This was the fifth homework assigned in the bootcamp. The purpose of this was to teach us about Timeouts and Intervals.

#### Game Mechanics
    - Click the answer choices
    - If you answer the questions correctly, your choice will be highlighted in blue and you will get a point in the correct box
    - If you answer wrong, your choice will be highlighted in pink, while the correct answer is highlighted in blue, and you will get a point in the incorrect box
    - If you run out of time. then you will get a point in the incorrect box
    - Press restart game to restart at any time.
    
**Known Issues:** The reset button doesn't work properly. Forgot to clear the timeout, and it will cause the game to speed up dramatically if clicked multiple times.

**Potential Improvements:** More trivia questions, and a randomization of the questions.
